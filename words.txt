I am writing something. Yes, I plan to make it the most boring thing ever written. I go to the store. A car is parked. Many cars are parked or moving. Some are blue. Some are tan. They have windows. In the store, there are items for sale. These include such things as soap, detergent, magazines, and lettuce. You can enhance your life with these products. Soap can be used for bathing, be it in a bathtub or in a shower. Apply the soap to your body and rinse. Detergent is used to wash clothes. Place your dirty clothes into a washing machine and add some detergent as directed on the box. Select the appropriate settings on your washing machine and you should be ready to begin. Magazines are stapled reading material made with glossy paper, and they cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from news and politics to business and stock market information. Some magazines are concerned with more recreational topics, like sports card collecting or different kinds of hairstyles. Lettuce is a vegetable. It is usually green and leafy, and is the main ingredient of salads. You may have an appliance at home that can quickly shred lettuce for use in salads. Lettuce is also used as an optional item for hamburgers and deli sandwiches. Some people even eat lettuce by itself. I have not done this. So you can purchase many types of things at stores. Hiro did you know though that toads eat lunch with Luigi, we all know that Luigi doesn't like that so he eats his back pack instead causing the toads to go zip-lining. Sadly for Luigi though the toads forgot about them being able to zip line so they fell off into the sky where the sky had just eaten them and then given them fire. Fire is very harmful to Luigis as we all know so yeah. And that back pack in the end was just a tiny floor made of roofs all combined together. Those roofs came from the ancient world of the lunch room where the pole got lung cancer and then died of toe damage. The pole later came over for a cup of tea but Luigi came up to my house before that drank all the cookies. If I drive around, I sometimes notice the houses and buildings all around. There are also pieces of farm land that are very large. Houses can be built from different kinds of materials. The most common types are brick, wood, and vinyl or synthetic siding. Houses have lawns that need to be tended. Lawns need to be mowed regularly. Most people use riding lawnmowers to do this. You can also use a push mower. These come in two varieties: gas-powered and manual. You don’t see manual push-mowers very much anymore, but they are a good option if you do not want to pollute the air with smoke from a gas-powered lawnmower. I notice that many families designate the lawnmowing responsibility to a teenager in the household. Many of these teenagers are provided with an allowance for mowing the yard, as well as performing other chores, like taking out the trash, washing the dishes, making their bed, and keeping the house organized. Allowances are small amounts of money given by parents to their children, usually on a weekly basis. These usually range from 5 dollars to 15 dollars, sometimes even 20 dollars. Many parents feel that teenagers can learn financial responsibility with this system. Now I will talk about farm land. Farm land can be identified by some common features. They almost always consist of a very large patch of dirt with small green plants lined up in very long rows. You may sometimes see farm equipment riding over these rows, like tractors or combines. These machines help farmers grow more crops in less time. They are a very helpful invention. Some different types of crops are soybeans, cotton, corn, tomatoes, tobacco, and lettuce. Most crops are used as food, and can be defined as either fruits or vegetables. Some are commonly eaten raw, after being rinsed in water to remove any dirt. Some are often cooked, which helps give them a more pleasant taste and makes them easier to chew. A very versatile vegetable is the potato. It can be eaten raw, or it can be cooked in a variety of ways. They can be baked, and many people like to add butter to them. They can be mashed, and a lot of times brown gravy or milk gravy is poured on top of them. They can be cut into thin strips and fried. Typically a large amount of grease is required to prepare potatoes in this style, but they are easy to make and easy to eat. You can order them at several fast-food restaurants. Potatoes can also be boiled, stewed, and scalloped. There is a wide variety of options available to you when cooking potatoes. Some other types of crops grown on farm land are used for other purposes. Cotton is used to make clothing. It is a very versatile and inexpensive material for clothes. Such items as shirts, pants, socks, and underwear can be made from cotton. The process of converting cotton from a cotton plant to clothing is fairly complicated. Today, cotton is harvested more efficiently through the use of the cotton gin, invented by Eli Whitney many years ago. Tobacco is another type of crop. It is used in making cigarettes. A lot of people smoke cigarettes, even though many medical sources have identified them as harmful to people’s health. Warnings are printed on cigarette packages reminding people of possible dangers resulting from smoking. Cigarettes are available in several brands, including Marlboro, Salem, and Virginia Slims. There is a brand called Kool, but I don’t know whether they are still available at most outlets. Tobacco farming is a large industry, and currently there is debate about it. Recently the government decided on some regulations that cost tobacco companies a large amount of money. If you notice, some farm lands have animals living on them. Most of these are cows, and there are also pigs, sheep, and goats living on farms. Some are raised for the milk they provide. This milk goes through several processes to ensure that it is not contaminated before it is made available to consumers at stores. Another use for farm animals is meat. Three popular types of meat are beef, pork, and chicken. Beef comes from cows. Pork comes from pigs. Chicken comes from chickens, but you probably knew that. These animals are raised to become plump and healthy, then they are killed, sometimes at slaughter houses. The meat is then removed from their bodies, cleaned, and made available at a variety of stores and restaurants. Sometimes this process can seem gross, but it is part of an advanced ecological food chain on earth. Just like birds eat worms and tigers eat deer, human beings eat cows and pigs. The main difference is that we don’t eat animals raw. We cook the meat to remove blood, fat, and germs from it. We also season our meat with salt or different kinds of sauces. The end result is food that is very tasty and is healthy for us. Farmers do not like trespassers. If a farmer sees one, he will sometimes shoot at them with a shotgun that he owns. Trespassing is against the law. Laws are created by government to prevent people from living in fear. They are meant to provide safety for citizens. Our government in America consists of a legislative branch, an executive branch, and a judicial branch. The legislative branch makes laws based on the concerns of citizens they represent. The executive branch consists of the President. This person enforces the law, and he has certain other duties like declaring war and approving bills prepared by members of the legislative branch. The President is also considered the leader of our country. The judicial branch interprets the laws. This branch consists of the courts and the trials held in them. Here a judge and jury determine from evidence presented by lawyers whether someone is guilty of breaking a law. Initial law enforcement takes place among police officers. They are the first people to encounter situations where a law is being broken. If a criminal becomes too violent or hostile, they will use guns or mace or nightsticks to administer immediate punishment. Their goal is to bring the criminal under control, so that he can receive a punishment determined by members of the judicial branch of government. Punishments mostly include time in jail, but they can also include fines and, in extreme cases, the death penalty. There is controversy surrounding the death penalty. Children play with toys. This is common to almost all kids. Toys come in a very wide variety. Boys tend to like cars, action figures, and toy weapons. Girls tend to like dolls, toy kitchens, and make-up. Both of them like building or assembling things, be it with Legos, blocks, Play-Doh, or something similar. Toys can be found at most stores, and these days entire stores are dedicated to selling only toys. The most popular of these is Toys ‘R’ Us. Their mascot is Geoffrey the Giraffe. Children love to go to Toys ‘R’ Us and look at the wide variety of toys available. Most children receive the greatest quanitity of toys on their birthdays, or during the holiday season in December. For the majority of children, this holiday is Christmas. For Jewish children, the holiday is Channakuh. Either way, the kid gets presents during this time, and most of these presents are toys. Children are told that Santa’s elves build their toys, and Santa delivers them personally to each house in the world by riding in an airborne sleigh hauled by nine reindeer, including Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, who leads the way. Another popular Christmas character is Frosty the Snowman. Frosty is basically any snowman that comes to life. So during Christmas, many children build snowmen, and some of them hope that theirs might come to life. But all of these characters are myths. The true origin of Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Jesus, who founded the religion of Christianity a couple of thousand years ago. I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. Other holidays include Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Independence Day. Thanksgiving has become a tradition of preparing large quantities of food for a large gathering of people, mainly family and friends. This meal usually features turkey or ham as the main course. Turkey and ham are both kinds of meat. The meal usually also consists of dressing and a wide assortment of vegetables. The origin of Thanksgiving is usually traced to the days of the pilgrims, who were the first settlers in America. They made peace with the native people, the Indians, and together enjoyed a large feast, thanking God for providing them with such an abundance. Halloween is the holiday when people dress in costumes to look like other characters. Most of these are children, who go from door to door in different neighborhoods to request candy from the people living there. I will not say much about Independence Day, but it is the day Americans celebrate the anniversary of our independence from Britain. Most families purchase fireworks during this holiday and set them off in their lawns. America gained independence from Britain in the late 1700’s after the Revolutionary War. Britain was hoping to extend its empire across the Atlantic Ocean, but the colonists who settled the territory did not want to be under Britain’s control, with their various taxes and regulations. Both sides were very passionate about their position on the issue, so a war occurred. This war featured a few heroes, including George Washington and Paul Revere. George Washington became America’s first president when we gained independence. I am not sure what happened to Paul Revere. The Declaration of Independence was written before the war by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 and made clear the position of the colonists. It was signed by many important people, including Ben Franklin and John Hancock. Ben Franklin is well-known for many things. One of these is inventing electrical conductors in the form of lightning rods. A famous tale is that he flew a kite with a small piece of metal somewhere on the string during a lightning storm. This was an effective way to test his theory. Another thing Ben Franklin is known for is publishing Poor Richards Almanac. This was like a magazine and contained some of his famous writings and quotations. Trees are one of our most important natural resources. They are made of wood, and wood can be made into a variety of products. Some of the more obvious kinds are furniture, houses, and toothpicks. However, wood can also be made into paper. When I first heard this, I was skeptical, but it is true. Paper is a very important product in our society. Writers and artists have greatly benefited from the invention of paper. With only some paper and a pen or pencil, a writer can produce stories and poems that can captivate readers. They can also write down historical facts about their society. Actually, these writings don’t become historical until years later. At the time, the writings could probably be considered news. Artists use paper for their drawings and paintings. They can also use canvas. Drawings and paintings can be very beautiful. They can depict a wide variety of subjects, including flowers, animals, landscapes, and people. They can be realistic or impressionistic. Some paintings also attempt to convey emotions merely by the way the colors are combined and the brushstrokes are applied. This is a modern or contemporary approach to art. Many people think this approach does not require as much talent as the realistic styles. Sammy is secretly an undercover police officer. This was proven by Hiro. Ayan also answered this question, but that proves nothing, Sunshine Ray became Emo and became Darkshine Ray, and ayan was never seen again at school. Nikki wins a trophy for best mathmatician in Nevada but gives the trophy to Sammy. Lucian hacks the school wifi and accidentally breaks the school wifi from the inside. Emoly will forever be emo. Hiro is not emo. Cookies are cool but they're too bland sometimes. Lube the Lucian secretly makes a prototype of the Poato Gernade and destroys the cybersecurity room by accident. This paragraph is stupid. Hiro destroys Sammy by forcing him to do another seminar in science class. Hiro will not stop typing until he is finished with his paragraph. Kelvin is cool. One day Hiro will get a dollar. Hiro has broken a chromebook for the fifth time at this point. Second lunch is better than first lunch because it's after first lunch and takes place later in the day. TKAM is a confusing book. I am continuously typing. Lucian wants me to finish typing quickly. Some people in the world are weird. Sammy and Nikki enjoy roleplaying. Hiro is called Hero sometimes and he accidentally calls himself Hero. This paragraph will now end. I would make it longer but there is no time. Hiro is in health class. Health class sucks. Coach Kiel is awkward and talks too much. Lucian should speak in his class, but he chooses not to. Siwon is the teacher's pet in health class. Hiro is sometimes Hero but they're pronounced the same way. Wait did coach Kiel just mark me absent. EmoWriter is too emo. Hiro is not Emo. Emily is Emo. Trust. Lucian has multiple nicknames, consisting of Lube, Lood, and Lucy. I have many nicknames, consisting of Hiro, Hero, Hirotakis, Hirotacos, Hirotikitakis, and Hi-ro. Nikki is a potato and Ayan has no nickname. Ray is still sunshine or a penguin I guess. January seventeenth is a bad day. It's very boring. Sometimes, Hiro is stupid. Most of the time, Hiro is stupid. Actually, he's stupid all the time. Lube stole Sammy's spot at lunch. He seems to be depressing and lonely. Hero finished robotics assignments but they sucked. I am weird. Dont you just hate it when your train has a seizure. Honestly the train just starts to go upside down the next day because of the wrong colors. And this is why the train needed a bigger train so the train could fit inside of the Norwhale. That norwhale though had to eat a banana backwards in order to not give the train a seizure with glasses. I think that that is just tomorrow in the past 5 days tomorrow in midnight in the morning because I needed my glasses and could not see the pole with my backpack. And I hate it when the backpack stole my pole because the pole stole my backpack in the sun. Honestly naruto is just a norwhale in production because when I see my glasses the vending machine start to throw its self at me and then I have to drop kick the train as it is being very rude and looking at me with those weird glasses. The glasses don't even fit the trash which is the void of the world. No light ever comes in and out of the trash can and that is because a miniature truck with type 2 diabetes comes out and has a seizure at its toes. Thats why I watch naruto because the number green is just blue backwards and tomorrow the lettus is going to go fight back and then a bag of chips from the vending machine will start to go fight a keyboard. So in all I think that the norwhales are very mean and that they need glasses. Because if they dont then whon will figure out why number 6 is called number 6 today and then tommorow it will be number 6 again. And my backpack is planning on going to go fight jupitar because jupitar and my desk have some kind of beef going on. Hiro is not emo. Hiro is parked, the new slang for cool. Doing drugs is bad. Don't visit the drug dealer in the alleyway. Meat is good. It tastes exceptional and is a great source of protein. Las Vegas is very hot. However, it's also cold at times. School should give us money. I hate studying. Screw study guides. Sammy's wife is divorced. He will forever be alone. Ayan cries when he gets divorced from a calculator. Luckily for him, there are plenty of calculators in the stores. Emily is emoly. Edge E Edgelord and Emo E Elmo are not the same person. They both have distinguishing properties. I am cool trust. Twenty-five hours had passed since the incident. It seemed to be a lot longer than that. That twenty-five hours seemed more like a week in her mind. The fact that she still was having trouble comprehending exactly what took place wasn't helping the matter. She thought if she could just get a little rest the entire incident might make a little more sense. The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing. There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land. Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but Sammy has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try. What have you noticed today. What have you noticed today. I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back. He collected the plastic trash on a daily basis. It never seemed to end. Even if he cleaned the entire beach, more plastic would cover it the next day after the tide had come in. Although it was a futile effort that would never be done, he continued to pick up the trash each day. His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He'd tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind. The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime. They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved. She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out of her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready. She looked deeply into his eyes and said, octopus. Dragons don't exist they said. They are the stuff of legend and people's imagination. Kelvin would have agreed with this assessment without a second thought 24 hours ago. But now that there was a dragon staring directly into his eyes, he questioned everything that he had been told. Sometimes there isn't a good answer. No matter how you try to rationalize the outcome, it doesn't make sense. And instead of an answer, you are simply left with a question. Why. Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Sarah. She didn't have a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't even a note attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, but that wasn't the way Sarah did things. Now it was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose. With six children in tow, Nikki raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn't an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Emily made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane. His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He'd tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind. They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue. There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were simply walking and getting exercise. There were a few who were fishing. There was a family who had laid down a blanket and they were having a picnic. It was like this most days and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that nobody noticed the water leaking through the dam wall. The red line moved across the page. With each millimeter it advanced forward, something changed in the room. The actual change taking place was difficult to perceive, but the change was real. The red line continued relentlessly across the page and the room would never be the same. The time had come for Emoly to say goodbye. She had been dreading this moment for a good six months, and it had finally arrived despite her best efforts to forestall it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't keep the inevitable from happening. So the time had come for a normal person to say goodbye and move on. It was at this moment that Nikki decided not to be a normal person. After all the time and effort she had expended, she couldn't bring herself to do it. Nikki's friend who was here hardly had any issues at all, but she wasn't telling the truth. Yesterday, before she left to go home, she heard that her husband is in the hospital and pretended to be surprised. It later came out that she was the person who had put him there. He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred. It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred. Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time. They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know yourself better than those around you. Hiro knew nothing about this. He thought he had found peace but this was an illusion as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that he actually knew nothing about himself. Her sister listened intently and nodded in agreement. She didn't fully understand what her sister was saying but that didn't matter. She loved her so much that she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth. It was supposed to be a dream vacation. They had planned it over a year in advance so that it would be perfect in every way. It had been what they had been looking forward to through all the turmoil and negativity around them. It had been the light at the end of both their tunnels. Now that the dream vacation was only a week away, the virus had stopped all air travel. It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers. I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again. The shades were closed keeping the room dark. Ian knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight so he could begin the day, but he didn't have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as expected the day before and he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at the shades wondering if there was a way to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day. Housework could be everyone’s work, not just women's work. Why do women enable men to act oblivious to cleaning, grocery shopping, pet feeding, etc? Somehow when men live alone they figure out how to do all of those things all on their own. My friend’s husband claimed he didn’t know that sheets should be washed more than once a season. He said he didn’t know one had to clean toilets. He assumed that since you flush toilets they clean themselves. She tried to get him to help but he did an awful job so she let him off the hook. Wouldn’t it be better if she spent the time and energy to get him to do it right instead of letting him claim he is just bad at it. My sons were raised to clean toilets and change their own sheets. Hopefully, in their future homes, the housework will be equally divided. She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power to put her in the room, but not the power to make her repent. It wasn't fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she wouldn't change her attitude. At three years old, Knox's stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view. There wasn't a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. It was the clouds. The deep green that isn't the color of clouds, but came with these. She knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared. She counted. One. She could hear the steps coming closer. Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth. Three. He stopped beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun. She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn't scientifically prove any of this, but that didn't matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to. She didn't understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she couldn't see how anything was ever the same. The fight is never about grapes or lettuce. It is always about people. Lettuce is like conversation it must be fresh and crisp, so sparkling that you scarcely notice the bitter in it. I hate eating vegetables. The only vegetables I eat are lettuce on a burger. I know the price of lettuce. You buy the best lettuce you can at the best price you can. It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is sopoforic. Feed the lettuce to the bunny and eat the bunny. Most nights, I'm happy to stay at home with a DVD and a bowl of lettuce. I don't know how to cook lettuce. I mostly eat lettuce. Knox secretly really likes to eat dirt. He is addicted to it. He was a core witness in the cheating of Ayan and Sammy and was the one who caused it. Knox gave Ayan the idea that sammy wanted to be with him, and this chaos ensued. He would later be arrested on a Friday night by Undercover Cop Hiro. He would need to pay a fine to get out, but had only dirt with him and he has to serve the full 10 years for 2nd degree murder. It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it. The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. Knox knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness. Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't. Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and a spider crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I reached for the one small bath towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote control was sticky and wouldn’t stop scrolling through the channels. I gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down and to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear. After my initial relief that it wasn’t alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped out of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my car. He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent. Knox had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. This had made all the difference in the world. Being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend the rest of his life alone in a cell. He read about a hike called the incline in the guidebook. It said it was a strenuous hike and to bring plenty of water. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue. There was no ring on his finger. That was a good sign although far from proof that he was available. Still, it was much better than if he had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. She glanced at his hand a bit more intently to see if there were any tan lines where a ring may have been, and he's simply taken it off. She couldn't detect any which was also a good sign and a relief. The next step would be to get access to his wallet to see if there were any family photos in it. Encompassing geology, geophysics, hydrogeology, mineral engineering and many other fields, geoscience is a study of the entire Earth and the systems and forces that shape and reshape it. Before becoming an archaeologist and digging up dinosaur bones, Emily studied the earth while earning a degree in geoscience. Geosciences is an integrative science, combining many disciplines and touching many aspects of our lives. Nearly everything around you, from the mountains out your window to the cell phone in your hand to the water from your tap, is connected to geoscience. This meets the growing need to improve geoscience knowledge relevant to strategies for subsurface disposal of hazardous and radioactive wastes. As far as the job market is concerned, there will always be opportunities and needs for various geoscientists. A recent report indicates that there will be a growth in geoscience jobs. What I personally love about geoscience is that it is an integrative science; you learn some chemistry, physics, biology, geometry and geography to become a geoscientist. Of course, geoscience has its own principles and methods too, but it integrates other sciences in its workflow. A geoscience graduate should also preferably choose a certain discipline to master. Excellence comes from our passion, knowledge, and practice. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes all the same things that I do.

Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin. Warm beer on a cold day isn't my idea of fun. Honestly, I didn't care much for the first season, so I didn't bother with the second. The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig. They improved dramatically once the lead singer left. They desperately needed another drummer since the current one only knew how to play bongos. People keep telling me orange but I still prefer pink. Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they'll upset by the lack of biscuits. The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.

The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July. I want a giraffe, but I'm a turtle eating waffles.

He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat. She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining. She was the type of girl that always burnt sugar to show she cared. I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief. Just because the water is red doesn't mean you can't drink it. Today I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day. Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley. Please put on these earmuffs because I can't you hear. That is an appealing treasure map that I can't read. James liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream. I've always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me. If you spin around three times, you'll start to feel melancholy. I used to live in my neighbor's fishpond, but the aesthetic wasn't to my taste. Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding. I only enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent. He was the only member of the club who didn't like plum pudding. You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint. I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout. It isn't true that my mattress is made of cotton candy. I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit. Dr. Boyars knows the way to the bakery even though he's never been there. I never knew what hardship looked like until it started raining bowling balls. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands. Strawberries must be the one food that doesn't go well with this brand of paint. I'd always thought lightning was something only I could see. We're careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they're fruit. The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there's a long way to fall. Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition. There's no reason a hula hoop can't also be a circus ring. It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn't been painted to look like the sky. Nikki ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk. Emily had her best sleep ever on her new bed of nails. He never understood why what, when, and where left out who. Sammy figured the best way to succeed was to do the opposite of what he'd been doing all his life. Patricia found the meaning of life in a bowl of Cheerios. I'll have you know I've written over fifty novels That must be the tenth time I've been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars. Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion. The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law's bed. The most exciting eureka moment I've had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines. It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don't have to worry about leaving fingerprints. I've traveled all around Africa and still haven't found the gnu who stole my scarf. At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp. The chic gangster liked to start the day with a pink scarf. She was only made the society president because she can whistle with her toes. At last The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned. Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can't read. Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies. The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner. The water flowing down the river didn’t look that powerful from the car The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause’s belly. Little Red Riding Hood decided to wear orange today. The stench from the feedlot permeated the car despite having the air conditioning on recycled air. Sammy discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones. Nikki decided to make the porta-potty her home. Acres of almond trees lined the interstate highway which complimented the crazy driving nuts. They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy. Tomatoes make great weapons when water balloons aren’t available. The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance. Nikki thought the best way to create a welcoming home was to line it with barbed wire. The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy. The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge. The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world. His get rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm. Siri became confused when we reused to follow her directions. With the high wind warning She found it strange that people use their cellphones to actually talk to one another.

They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use. When confronted with a rotary dial phone the teenager was perplexed. The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.

The child’s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father’s lawnmower came in. Flash photography is best used in full sunlight. The llama couldn't resist trying the lemonade. I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn't want to die alone. I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow. I had a friend in high school named James, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport. The balloons floated away along with all my hopes and dreams. There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery. The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood. They say people remember important moments in their life well, yet no one even remembers their own birth. I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking. I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened. It's important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.

I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.

The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable. I trust everything that's written in purple ink. I'm not a party animal, but I do like animal parties. I've never seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine. Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe. There's a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels. You have no right to call yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a great lockpick. I can't believe this is the eighth time I'm smashing open my piggy bank on the same day! There's probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium. I'm worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model. My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession. It's never been my responsibility to glaze the donuts. He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years. Nikki prided herself on always taking the path less traveled. She'd decided to do this at an early age and had continued to do so throughout her entire life. It was a point of pride and she would explain to anyone who would listen that doing so was something that she'd made great efforts to always do. Breastfeeding is good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed get antibodies from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed babies have less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a baby lets the infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Mother’s who breastfeed lower their chances of developing breast cancer. Usually, mothers who breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more quickly and easily. The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous. She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time. The fog was as thick as pea soup. This was a problem. Sammy was driving but couldn't see a thing in front of him. He knew he should stop, but the road was narrow so if he did, it would be right in the center of the road. He was sure that another car would end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the lack of visibility. This was an unwise move. They told her that this was her once chance to show the world what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had told her that you don't show the world what you're made of when they are all watching, you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. It was looking more and more like her brother was correct. There was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn't matter. He was late and if he didn't make this meeting on time, someone's life may be in danger. Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about all you can do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She couldn’t reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the floor. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down. He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact. Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Nikki. She didn't have a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't even a note attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, but that wasn't the way Nikki did things. Now it was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose. The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Hiro swerved to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized that he'd somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension. It was a question he asked a hundred times a day and he always received the same answer. It had become such an ingrained part of his daily routine that he had to step back and actively think when he heard the little girl's reply. Nobody had before answered the question the way that she did, and James didn't know how he should respond. The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime. They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved. Sammy watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Nikki was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Sammy went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Nikki to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen. There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone. Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. The morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air. There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning. He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time. Ayan understood that this situation would make Michael terribly uncomfortable. Sammy simply had no idea what was about to come and even though Ayan could prevent it from happening, he opted to let it happen. It was quite ironic, really. It was something Ayan had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times, yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends. He rationalized that it would ultimately make Sammy a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable, everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime.
